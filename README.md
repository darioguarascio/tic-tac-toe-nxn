# Reinforcment Learning Web-Based TicTacToe

Inspired by [Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://github.com/antirez) educational [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwFNKCys9c) on [how matchboxes can learn to play tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine), here is a web-based implementation of the same approach, extended to have a configurable grid and strike sizes.
